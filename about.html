<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am called Marc Brian and I am 17 years old,  I love coding and learning.<br /> 
  I am a self taught  developer and one day I will become a senior  software developer specialised in Artificial intelligence <br />
  My desire and hardwork to be a producer of technology and not a consumer will take me there .
